# Laravel + Vue Starter Kit

## Introduction

Our Vue starter kit provides a robust, modern starting point for building Laravel applications with a Vue frontend using [Inertia](https://inertiajs.com).

Inertia allows you to build modern, single-page Vue applications using classic server-side routing and controllers. This lets you enjoy the frontend power of Vue combined with the incredible backend productivity of Laravel and lightning-fast Vite compilation.

This Vue starter kit utilizes Vue 3 and the Composition API, TypeScript, Tailwind, and the [shadcn-vue](https://www.shadcn-vue.com) component library.

## Local Development with DDEV

This project is configured to run locally with [DDEV](https://ddev.com). The app uses SQLite, so no database container is started.

```bash
ddev start
ddev composer install
ddev artisan key:generate
ddev exec touch database/database.sqlite
ddev artisan migrate --seed
ddev npm install
ddev npm run build   # or `ddev npm run dev` for Vite HMR
```

The site will then be available at `https://food-picker.ddev.site`.
